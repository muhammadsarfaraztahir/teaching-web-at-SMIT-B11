        You can find HTML attribute equivalents for many of the event handler
        properties; however, you shouldn't use these â€” they are considered bad
        practice. It might seem easy to use an event handler attribute if you
        are doing something really quick, but they quickly become unmanageable
        and inefficient.

        For a start, it is not a good idea to mix up your HTML and your
        JavaScript, as it becomes hard to read. Keeping your JavaScript separate
        is a good practice, and if it is in a separate file you can apply it to
        multiple HTML documents.

        Even in a single file, inline event handlers are not a good idea. One
        button is OK, but what if you had 100 buttons? You'd have to add 100
        attributes to the file; it would quickly turn into a maintenance
        nightmare. With JavaScript, you could easily add an event handler
        function to all the buttons on the page no matter how many there were,
        using something like this:
      </p>
    </div>
    <script type="module" src="./app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
